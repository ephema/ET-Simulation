Simulation on Execution Tickets for Ethereum

Execution Tickets are currently discussed as a promising next evolutionary step for enhancing Ethereum's block space allocation mechanism. With Execution Tickets the protocol sells the right for block building. This is done by offering tickets, which allow ticket holders to participate in a lottery to be drawn as the next block builder. It separates consensus rewards from execution rewards. It aims to foster decentralization among beacon chain validators and enable protocol-level capture of Maximum Extractable Value (MEV). 

In order to evalute the potential effects and mechanism design choices of execution tickets we built this simulation.
